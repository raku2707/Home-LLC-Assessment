# Home-LLC-Assessment

● OBJECTIVE:
Find publicly available data for key factors that influence US home prices nationally. Then, build a data science model that explains how these factors impacted home prices over the last 20 years.

● AIMS:
The project aims to build a data science model to predict U.S. home prices based on these factors over the last 20 years.

● STEPS:

1) Data Collection: Utilized the S&P Case-Schiller Home Price Index as a proxy for home prices, sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) website.

2) Key Factors: Gathered publicly available data on factors influencing home prices nationally, including Per Capita GDP, Consumer Price Index (CPI), Construction Material Costs, Median Income, Subsidies, and Population Demographics, etc.

3) Data Cleaning and Processing: Cleaned and processed the data, addressing missing values, converting date formats, and handling outliers.

4) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of variables, identify correlations, and visualize trends over time.

5) Model Selection: Explored various regression models, including Linear Regression, Elastic Net, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and XG Boost.

6) Model Training and Evaluation: Trained each model using a subset of the data, evaluated performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

7) Feature Importance: Analysed feature importance for models like Random Forest, XG Boost, and Gradient Boosting to understand the factors influencing home prices.

8) Model Comparison: Compare the performance of different models based on metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
Select the best-performing model that provides accurate predictions and insights into the factors influencing home prices over the last 20 years.

9) Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate the relationships between actual and predicted home prices for each model.
Visualize the importance of different features or coefficients in influencing home prices.

10) Conclusion: Identified strong contender for the best model, considering their low MSE and high R-squared values.
Draw conclusions about the key factors that have historically influenced US home prices.

11) Overall Implication: The project contributes to understanding the key factors influencing U.S. home prices over the last 20 years and provides a foundation for building robust predictive models in the real estate domain.
